0.3
---

This release fixes a lot of bugs with regard to unresolved/circular dependency detection
and ref counts.  The only missing pieces of the test suite now are entry/exit handlers,
and module role registration (which is part of the entry point tests).  I urge everyone
to upgrade from 0.2 to 0.3, as this contains criticil bug fixes that weren't uncovered
with the test suite contained in 0.2.

The following bugs still remain in this release, not all of which are within my control:

  - Mono does not honor the PrivatePath, so even though nmodule adds the search path to the
    appdomain's resolving path, it doesnt work.  The work around until Mono fixes this bug is
    to set MONO_PATH="$MONO_PATH:my_search_dir_1:mysearch_dir_2:...:my_search_dir_n".  This is
    unnecessary on Microsoft's implementation.

    - UPDATE:  I have provided a patch to the Mono folks to fix this issue, however, they have
      not added this yet to the distribution, in the meantime, you can apply the patch found at
      http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=57612 to make the search path work as expected.
      The patch was created against svn HEAD, but it also applies cleanly to 1.1.8.2.

  - This release contains monodoc generated documentation in api-docs.  This release does not
    contain build instructions for the documentation, so you're on your own with it.  The next
    release will contain build instructions for the monodoc documentation and ndoc documentation.

  - This release contains several components of the new NUnit based test suite.  However, currently it
    is not automated.

  - This releases nant build files do not contain an install target.  I will add that for the 0.4 release.
    Sorry I keep pushing this back, but I want to make sure the library works right before adding stuff.  0.4
    won't take long to release, I promise.

  - The test suite is built during the compile-all stage of the build.  There is a run-tests target, but this
    is not run by default, due to the above Mono bug.  If you would like to run it as part of your build
    process on Windows, do nant net-1.1 compile-all run-tests.

  - The test suite contained in this release is pretty compreshensive.  It contains a total of 44 tests,
    all of which pass.

  - This release is ready for use, unfortunately documentation is scarce.  I'll write up some documentation
    for 0.4, but until then you can reach me at mtindal@paradoxpoint.com   Enjoy!
