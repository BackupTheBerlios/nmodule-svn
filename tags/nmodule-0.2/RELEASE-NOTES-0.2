0.2
---

This release is fully functional, and is suitable for every day use.

The following bugs still remain in this release, not all of which are within my control:

  - Mono does not honor the PrivatePath, so even though nmodule adds the search path to the
    appdomain's resolving path, it doesnt work.  The work around until Mono fixes this bug is
    to set MONO_PATH="$MONO_PATH:my_search_dir_1:mysearch_dir_2:...:my_search_dir_n".  This is
    unnecessary on Microsoft's implementation.

  - This release contains monodoc generated documentation in api-docs.  This release does not
    contain build instructions for the documentation, so you're on your own with it.  The next
    release will contain build instructions for the monodoc documentation and ndoc documentation.

  - This release also contains an mbuild build system.  To use it, install mbuild from mono's svn, and
    mbuild -i ., mbuild -a.  Should be able to install from mbuild too, this has not been tested.

  - This release contains several components of the new NUnit based test suite.  However, currently it
    is not automated.

  - This releases nant build files do not contain an install target.  I will add that for the 0.3 release.

  - The test suite is built during the compile-all stage of the build.  There is a tests target, but this
    is not run by default, due to the above Mono bug.  If you would like to run it as part of your build
    process on Windows, do nant net-1.1 compile-all tests.  Next release this target will be renamed to
    run-tests.

  - Basic loading, unloading, and dependency resolution is tested this release, and it passes all 9 current tests.
    Next release will include 9 more dependency resolution tests, and five more components, including
    unresolved/circular dependency checking, role instantiantion, and entry/exit handling.  Also next release
    I will be splitting the tests into seperated classes to be ran instead of one giant test class.

  - This release is ready for use, unfortunately documentation is scarce.  I'll write up some documentation
    for 0.4, but until then you can reach me at mtindal@paradoxpoint.com   Enjoy!
