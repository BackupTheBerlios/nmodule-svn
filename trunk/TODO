0.2 release:

  - Write nant build scripts.  mbuild works, but its only available from mono's svn, and I'm not sure it runs on
    other runtimes.  So 0.2 will distribute a nant build file.
  - Write Unit Tests.  The following areas need to be checked:

    - Loading
    - Unloading
    - Loading w/ Dependency Resolution
    - Unresolved Dependencies
    - Circular Dependencies
    - RefCount Unloading
    - Role registration
    - Role instantiation

  - Generate monodoc documentation.
    
0.3 release:
  
  - Write up a MasterModuleController class.  This is what apps will use to handle modules.
    ModuleController will become a child class of the MasterModuleController, and is set up this way
    so modules can register new controllers for different roles.
  - Fix Resolve{,Check} and LoadRawFile so they can load a module of the form [_name]-*.dll.  This will allow
    versions in names, and multiple concurrent versions (so long as they do not overlay).
  - Add unit tests for the following:

    - Loading w/ Dependency Resolution on multiple versions
    - Multiple version blocking
    - Sub-module controller registration
    - Sub-module controller delegation
    - Sub-module controller role registration
    - Sub-module controller role instantiation

0.4 release:

   - Write entries for monodoc documentation.
   - Write XML comment stubs.

0.5 release:

   - Provide a ndoc project file.
   - Document all public/protected classes/members.

0.6+:

   Bug fixes as necessary.
