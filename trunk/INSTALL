Installing NModule is simple.

Windows:

  On Windows, simply run nant install.  This will install NModule to the GAC.
  
Linux:

  On Linux, you can also run nant install, but there are some properties that influence the build.
  
  The ones most notable of use are:
  
  install.libdir:  Defaults to "lib".  The name of the library dir, typically lib or lib64.
  install.prefix:  The prefix to install to, defaults to "/usr/local".  Packagers will likely want to set this to "/usr".
  install.destdir:  Defaults to "/".  The root directory of the destination.  Packagers can use this to install to a temp directory before merging to the real root.
  
  Other variables can be used to control more aspects of the installation process, see templates/nmodule-install.build for more information.
