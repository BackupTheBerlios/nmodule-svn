This is a minor release in terms of bug fixes.  It includes two new unit tests, for entry
handling and exit handling, and some API additions to ModuleController.  It has full class
documentation along with some auxillary documentation for things like roles, depstrings,
etc.  The mbuild files have been removed from this release in favor of the nant build
system.  In addition, due to the automatically generated ndoc documentation, monodoc documentation
has been removed.

The following bugs still remain in this release, not all of which are within my control:

  - Mono does not honor the PrivatePath, so even though nmodule adds the search path to the
    appdomain's resolving path, it doesnt work.  The work around until Mono fixes this bug is
    to set MONO_PATH="$MONO_PATH:my_search_dir_1:mysearch_dir_2:...:my_search_dir_n".  This is
    unnecessary on Microsoft's implementation.

    - UPDATE:  I have provided a patch to the Mono folks to fix this issue, however, they have
      not added this yet to the distribution, in the meantime, you can apply the patch found at
      http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=57612 to make the search path work as expected.
      The patch was created against svn HEAD, but it also applies cleanly to 1.1.8.2.

  - This release generates ndoc documentation.  Run the create-docs target to generate them.

  - This release contains several components of the new NUnit based test suite.  The run-tests target
    can run tests.

  - This release finally contains an install target.  On Windows this simply installs to the GAC.  On
    Linux it will install to the GAC as well, but there are variables you can use to control the process.
		Of note are install.destdir which can be used to install to an alternate root, and install.prefix which
		controls the installation prefix.  They default to / and /usr/local respectively.

  - The test suite is built during the compile-all stage of the build.  There is a run-tests target, but this
    is not run by default, due to the above Mono bug.  It is run as part of the all target, which will become
		the default in a future release.  On Mono you will need the above patch to automate the process.  Alternatively
		you could call a setenv task, but I think this is bad form.

  - The test suite contained in this release is pretty compreshensive.  It contains a total of 46 tests,
    all of which pass.
