NModule is a modular architecture for writing applications which are based on loadable-modules 
as their support platform rather than a monolithic platform, or as a base for adding plugin
support to an existing application.  NModule differs from other plugin systems in its extensible
architecture.  Where most plug-in systems use a predefined entry method to initialize the plugin
and retrieve necessary information, we use .NET's reflection capabilities to determine the
facilities a module offers, and retrieve the types needed.

NModule uses assembly-level attributes to define and resolve dependencies, declare what "roles"
a module fulfills, and determine a modules name and version.  Type introspection determines
the types needed to fulfill each role.

NModule is also free to use, and is licensed under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

To begin using NModule, look at the properties file in the top-level directory to define
how you want the build to look.  You can also look at nmodule.build to determine what targets
you may need to run.  Afterwards, merely run nant with any of the targets you want to run (the
default just runs the "build" target), and then you can install using nant install
-D:install.prefix="/path/i/want/to/install/to".

A complete API documentation tree can be generated using the nant docs target, note however
that generating the documentation requires ndoc.
